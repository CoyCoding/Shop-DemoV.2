# Shop-DemoV.2
A start on a shop in C# with gui

A quick mock up of a shop.

I am constantly working on things but I did this yesterday and built it again for practice and added some features Naming is a bit poor, but I didnt think I would upload it(changed my mind).

As of right now it can:

Move items from a dummy Store a shopping cart.

From the shopping cart to back to the Store.

Tracks quantity as product is moved.

Puchase clears the Shopping cart.
